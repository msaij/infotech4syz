## Usage

### State Management
- Filter state is managed in the main `DeliveryChallanClient` component
- Uses React's `useState` and `useMemo` for efficient updates
- Filter logic is applied to the data before rendering

### Data Flow
1. Raw data comes from SSE (Server-Sent Events)
2. Filter state is applied to create `filteredRows`
3. Filtered data is passed to table and mobile list components
4. Customer list is extracted from raw data for the dropdown

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Filter dropdown adapts to screen size
- Touch-friendly controls on mobile devices
- Proper spacing and sizing for all screen sizes

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- Save filter preferences to localStorage
- Export filtered data with filter criteria
- Advanced search with multiple field matching
- Date picker with calendar interface
- Filter presets for common queries
- Real-time filter suggestions based on data
